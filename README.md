# Synchronverter Model: A Study on Self-Synchronized Synchronverters

This repository provides a model and a detailed report on **self-synchronized synchronverter**, inverter that mimic a synchronous generator. The synchronverter concept bridges the gap between conventional power generation and renewable energy integration in smart grids, offering a seamless mechanism for synchronizing power inverters with the grid without the need for a dedicated synchronization unit, such as a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL).

## Introduction

### Synchronous Generators
A **synchronous generator** operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. These generators play a vital role in power systems by maintaining the grid’s frequency and voltage stability.

### Synchronverters
A **synchronverter** is a type of inverter designed to behave like a synchronous generator, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources into the grid. Synchronverters regulate real and reactive power, frequency, and voltage using control algorithms modeled after synchronous machines. 

**Self-synchronized synchronverters**, as discussed in this report, remove the need for a PLL-based synchronization unit, instead embedding synchronization directly into the control algorithms. This simplifies the system while improving performance and reducing computational load.

Abstract: A synchronverter is an inverter that mimics synchronous generators, which offers a mechanism for power systems to control grid-connected renewable energy and facilitates smart grid integration. Similar to other grid-connected inverters, it needs a dedicated synchronization unit, e.g., a phase-locked loop (PLL), to provide the phase, frequency, and amplitude of the grid voltage as references. In this paper, a radical step is taken to improve the synchronverter as a self-synchronized synchronverter by removing the dedicated synchronization unit. It can automatically synchronize itself with the grid before connection and track the grid frequency after connection. This considerably improves the performance, reduces the complexity, and computational burden of the controller. All the functions of the original synchronverter, such as frequency and voltage regulation, real power, and reactive power control, are maintained. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the control strategy. Experimental results have shown that the proposed control strategy can improve the performance of frequency tracking by more than 65%, the performance of real power control by 83%, and the performance of reactive power control by about 70%.
